# Multisitesso - Micro Frontend User Profile Widget

A comprehensive micro frontend user profile management system with Google-style cross-domain authentication.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a sophisticated micro frontend architecture featuring:

- **Widget Host** (website1.com) - React/Remix-based user profile widget
- **React Client** (website2.com) - React application with widget integration  
- **PHP Client** (website3.com) - PHP application with widget integration
- **Cross-Domain Authentication** - Seamless authentication across all domains

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system uses a micro frontend approach where a central widget hosted on website1.com can be embedded and used across different domains and frameworks, maintaining seamless user authentication similar to how Google services work across youtube.com and gmail.com.
