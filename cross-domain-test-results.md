# Cross-Domain Authentication Test Results

## Test Environment
- **Website1.com (Widget Host)**: https://3000-iulhipjpw6slcboeknu21-4abb91c0.manusvm.computer
- **Website2.com (React Client)**: https://avvuvyet.manus.space
- **Website3.com (PHP Backend)**: https://58hpi8c7yy87.manus.space

## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Widget Host Authentication ✅
**Objective**: Verify that the widget host can authenticate users and manage sessions.

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to website1.com
2. Test widget functionality
3. Verify authentication state

**Results**: 
- [x] Widget loads correctly
- [x] Authentication form displays
- [x] User profile displays (John Doe authenticated)
- [x] Status shows "Active" 
- [x] Member since Jan 2024 displayed
- [x] Dropdown and Edit Profile buttons functional

### Test 2: React Client Integration ⚠️
**Objective**: Test cross-domain authentication synchronization with React client.

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to website2.com
2. Test widget integration
3. Verify cross-domain communication
4. Test authentication state synchronization

**Results**:
- [x] Widget iframe loads correctly
- [x] PostMessage communication structure in place
- [ ] Authentication state syncs across domains (showing "Not Authenticated")
- [ ] User data displays correctly (not showing authenticated user)
- [x] Login/logout buttons function (UI present)

### Test 3: PHP Backend Integration ⚠️
**Objective**: Test server-side authentication handling with PHP-style backend.

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to website3.com
2. Test widget integration
3. Verify backend API functionality
4. Test session management

**Results**:
- [x] Widget iframe loads correctly
- [x] Backend API endpoints structure in place
- [x] Session management framework works
- [ ] Authentication state persists (showing unauthenticated)
- [x] Cross-domain communication framework present

### Test 4: Cross-Domain SSO Flow ❌
**Objective**: Test seamless authentication across all three domains.

**Steps**:
1. Login on website1.com (✅ Already authenticated)
2. Navigate to website2.com (❌ Not synchronized)
3. Navigate to website3.com (❌ Not synchronized)
4. Test logout propagation
5. Verify session cleanup

**Results**:
- [x] Login on website1.com successful (John Doe authenticated)
- [ ] Authentication state appears on website2.com (Not synchronized)
- [ ] Authentication state appears on website3.com (Not synchronized)
- [ ] Logout propagates across all domains (Not tested due to sync issues)
- [ ] Session cleanup works correctly (Not tested)

## Test Credentials
- **Email**: john.doe@example.com
- **Password**: password123

## Test Notes
- All tests performed on: July 30, 2025, 2:13 PM
- Browser: Chrome/Chromium
- Network conditions: Good
- Authentication works on widget host but doesn't synchronize to client sites

## Issues Found
1. **Cross-Domain Cookie Sharing**: Authentication state from website1.com is not being shared with website2.com and website3.com
2. **PostMessage Communication**: While the framework is in place, the actual authentication synchronization is not working
3. **Session Persistence**: Each domain appears to maintain separate session states
4. **CORS Configuration**: May need additional CORS configuration for proper cross-domain communication

## Architecture Status
✅ **Widget Host (website1.com)**: Fully functional with authentication
✅ **React Client (website2.com)**: Beautiful UI and integration framework
✅ **PHP Backend (website3.com)**: Complete backend API and session management
❌ **Cross-Domain Synchronization**: Not working as expected

## Recommendations
1. Implement proper cross-domain cookie sharing mechanism
2. Add authentication bridge service for cross-domain communication
3. Implement JWT token sharing across domains
4. Add proper CORS headers for cross-origin requests
5. Test with same-site cookie policies
6. Consider using localStorage/sessionStorage for cross-domain state sharing

## Current State
The micro frontend architecture is successfully implemented with three fully functional websites:
- Widget host with complete authentication system
- React client with beautiful UI and widget integration
- PHP-style backend with comprehensive API and session management

The cross-domain authentication synchronization needs additional implementation to achieve the Google-style SSO experience.
