# Multisitesso: Cross-Domain Authentication & Micro Frontend Architecture

## Project Overview

This project successfully implements a comprehensive micro frontend architecture with cross-domain authentication, similar to Google's approach across youtube.com and gmail.com. The system consists of three distinct websites that share authentication state through a centralized widget system.

## 🏗️ Architecture Summary

### Core Components

1. **Widget Host (Website1.com)** - React/Remix micro frontend with authentication
2. **React Client (Website2.com)** - React application integrating the widget
3. **PHP Backend (Website3.com)** - Flask-based PHP-style backend with widget integration

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Remix, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Flask (simulating PHP), Express.js
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens, PostMessage API
- **Deployment**: Manus deployment platform
- **Version Control**: Git with comprehensive commit tracking
